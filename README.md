# [Advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

A daily updated repository of my Python solutions for the Advent of Code challenges. This project reflects my journey of
learning Python and enhancing my problem-solving skills, one puzzle at a time.<br>
For each puzzle, I will give my personal difficulty, how I proceeded to solve it and what I learned from it.

## [Day 1](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/tree/main/day1)

### [Part 1](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day1/part1.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

#### Duration: 5 minutes

This was really easy.
I read the file line by line.
For each line, I save the digits in an array.
I get the first and last digit and merged them together to create a number.
And add this number to a sum through each iteration.

#### Learned concepts

- List comprehension
- with to close a resource automatically

### [Part 2](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day1/part2.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ

#### Duration: 60 minutes

This one was a bit more challenging. I had no idea how to proceed at first to get all the digits in words as numbers. I
first thought about using split by numbers. When I don‚Äôt know if I can do something in Python, I usually ask Bing Chat.
I asked him if there was a way to split a string by numbers. He told me that I could use the re module. After doing so,
I realized that it didn‚Äôt solve my problem. Then I learned about the findall method. I used it to get all the numbers in
the string with the regex `one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|\d`. Then I used a dictionary to get the number
associated with the word. I thought I was done, but then I realized that for more complicated strings
like `nineoneonetwoneightwo`, there were some numbers missing. The last digit `two` was missing for example. It would
find `eight` and I suppose it wouldn‚Äôt use the letter t to compose the word `two`. <br> I then decided to use search
instead of findall. It would only return the first match, but then I thought that I could use it in reverse too. I
checked the documentation but didn‚Äôt find a way to start by finding the last match. I decided to reverse the string and
then use search to get the last match. I also had to reverse the dictionary to get the matching string.

#### Learned concepts

- library re
- dictionary
- extended slice
- raw string

## [Day 2](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/tree/main/day2)

### [Part 1](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day2/part1.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

#### Duration: 48 minutes

It wasn‚Äôt challenging. Honestly, the most difficult part was naming all the variables to make them understandable. I had
to perform multiple splits and I wanted to avoid using the same variable name for each one. The logic was quite
straightforward. I created a dictionary with the color name as the key and the highest quantity found at once as the
value. Then, I checked if any of these values were higher than the one given in the puzzle. Voil√†!<br>

I was keen on making the code as clean as possible. I provided the type for almost every variable and tried to use as
few hard-coded values as possible. I am quite pleased with the result.

#### Concepts Learned

- Type hinting
- Naming variables can be hard üòÖ

### [Part 2](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day2/part2.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

#### Duration: 4 minutes

I can‚Äôt believe how straightforward it was. I spent more time writing this text than coding the solution. I simply had
to use the previous function, but instead of comparing the maximum allowed quantity, I had to multiply the quantities of
each color. I am really satisfied with what I have accomplished. Thanks to my meticulous approach in the previous part,
I barely had to make any changes to make it work.

#### Concepts Learned

- how important avoiding magic numbers is üòá

## [Day 3](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/tree/main/day3)

### [Part 1](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day3/part1.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ

#### Duration: 3 hours 36 minutes

This was indeed a challenging task. I misunderstood the puzzle not just once, but twice. Initially, I thought I was only
supposed to check the numbers adjacent to the symbols. Then, I believed I was only supposed to check the top, left,
bottom, and right. It finally dawned on me that I also had to check the diagonals. <br>

I also lost some time due to my unfamiliarity with the Iterator. I wasn't aware that I couldn't iterate over it more
than once. To overcome this, I had to cast it to a list, which allowed me to iterate over it multiple times. <br>

To make the solution as efficient as possible, I utilized a couple of data structures. This might make the solution
appear a bit more complicated.<br>

Despite these challenges, I don't think the problem was particularly hard. The code is quite well-documented, so I'll
provide a quick explanation of the logic here:<br>

1. I created a list of tuples that retain the line of a symbol and its match.
2. I created a set of adjacent coordinates that I would need to check.
3. I created a dictionary with the line as the key and a list of numbers and their respective match.
4. Finally, I summed all the numbers that are in a candidate coordinate.

On a side note, I had a rough start to the day of the challenge. I had only slept for 3 hours and woke up at 6 am when
the challenge started. I had to spot the first misinterpretation right away because I had to go to work.

#### Concepts Learned

- Iterable can't be iterated more than once
- Manipulating set
- Manipulating dictionary
- How important it is to understand the problem before starting to code ü´†

### [Part 2](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day3/part1.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ‚òÜ

#### Duration: 1 hour 16 minutes

The logic remains the same, but I had to associate each match with all candidate coordinates. <br>

This led to some key issues with the dictionary. However, it resolved the problem where a number wouldn't appear
multiple times if it was associated with multiple gears, and the fact that I had no way to associate a number with a
gear. <br>

This allowed me to link all adjacent numbers to a gear.

## [Day 4](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day4)

### [Part 1](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day4/part1.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

#### Duration: 15 minutes

This was easy. Just split split split everywhere. The "hardest" part was managing the times 2, but even that is simple.

### [Part 2](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day4/part2.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ‚òÜ

#### Duration: Approximately 2 hours

This task was quite lengthy because I lost track of what I wanted to achieve multiple times. The fact that I didn't
create any functions in the first exercise didn't help either. As this one was more complex, I decided to create
functions and even created a class for the Scratchcard. <br>

I had to put some thought into the recursive function. I initially planned to do it iteratively, but that seemed more
challenging. I'm quite satisfied with how I managed to implement it recursively. However, it takes several seconds to
run. I'm not sure if this is due to the recursive function or because I created a new Scratchcard every time I call
the `get_rewardd(self)` function in Scratchcard. I might decide to optimize it someday in the future, but that won't be
anytime soon.

#### Concepts Learned

- Class
- List comprehension

## [Day 5](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day5)

### [Part 1](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day5/part1.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

#### Duration: Approximately 3 hours

I encountered a problem with the `pop` function. Initially, I was under the impression that it removed an element from
the beginning of a list, but it actually removes from the end. <br>

The inputs were quite large and difficult to handle. <br>

In the map input, the destination was placed before the source, which was confusing. <br>

The key value from `a_to_b` was a tuple of strings, but I should have used a single string and obtained the path from a
different source.<br>

I realized that the input values were extremely large. It wasn't feasible to create a complete dictionary, so I had to
keep track of the offset for a specific range.<br>

I made a mistake when I used a `continue` statement instead of `break`. ü•≤

#### Concepts Learned

- pop
- list comprehension
- dictionary
- continue vs break
- storing the minimum amount of data is valuable

### [Part 2](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day5/part2.py)

#### Difficulty: üíÄ

#### Duration: ??

I suspect there might be a nested loop in my code. Despite my efforts to optimize it, I didn't succeed. I spent an
entire day trying to solve and optimize this issue.<br>
When I ran out of ideas, I turned to Bing chat for help. I utilized as many Python functions as possible with
IntervalThree and multi-threading, but to no avail. Eventually, I had to abandon my approach.<br>
In the end, I resorted to a completely different solution that I found online. To be honest, I don't fully understand it
yet.

#### Concepts Learned

- intervaltree
- multi-threading
- python functions
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)

## [Day 6](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day6)

### [Part 1](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day6/part1.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

#### Duration: 1 hours 10 minutes

I misunderstood the assignment once again. I was under the impression that I had to keep only the fastest races, not all
those that exceeded the previous record. <br>
I spent more time searching for suitable data structures than actually solving the problem. The task was quite
straightforward otherwise.

#### Concepts learned

- heapq

### [Part 2](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day6/part2.py)

#### Difficulty: üß∏

The only modification I made was in the way the lines were read.<br>
However, after resolving this, I looked up an online solution. I think I'll adopt this approach daily from now on. The
solution presented wasn't necessarily more optimal, but it did provide strategies for faster resolution.

#### Concepts learned

- zip

## [Day 7](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day7)

### [Part 1](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day7/part1.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ‚òÜ

#### Duration: 1 hours 10 minutes

The underlying logic of the code was fairly straightforward. There was no need to handle straights and flushes. I simply
kept track of the repetition of each card.<br>
The more challenging part was determining which hand was superior to the other. For this, I created a class that would
keep track of the cards converted to an integer and their bid. I had to define the `__lt__` function to allow `heapq` to
sort it.<br>
I manually input each scenario and assigned them arbitrary values. The code has a lot of if-else statements, but I
couldn't think of a different way to handle it.<br>
If two hands had the same combination, I checked the cards one by one and used an `Enum` to assign values to them.
However, this was unnecessary. I could have simply used a dictionary, but I forgot about them at the time. I did
implement this in the second part.<br>
Finally, I used `heapq` to sort all the hands.

#### Concepts learned

- not to use Enum
- all the compare function in a class
- heapq uses lt

### [Part 2](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day7/part2.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

#### Duration: 30 minutes

The task initially appeared to be more intricate than it truly was.<br>My first step was to substitute the unwieldy enum
with a straightforward function that utilized a map, setting the value of `J` to 0.<br>

In my implementation, I focused on tracking the count of repetitions rather than the cards themselves. This allowed me
to simply augment the highest occurrences by the count of `J`s.<br>

I did face a challenge when `J` emerged as the most frequent value or if `J` was the sole value in the hand. I addressed
this by eliminating its occurrence and incrementing the count of `J`s to the first element of my sorted hand, which
maintains the repetition count for each card.<br>

Upon making this adjustment, I noticed that I could alter the `if-else` conditions since I can now directly access the
first element instead of using `max()`. Moreover, I believe that invoking `max()` every time I performed the check,
rather than sorting from the start, was inefficient. However, I decided not to modify this at the moment due to other
project commitments.<br>

## [Day 8](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day8)

### [Part 1](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day8/part1.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ

#### Duration: 2 hours

Once again, I misunderstood the assignment. I‚Äôve reached a point where I know I‚Äôll be giving myself extra work every day
because of this.<br>

Initially, I believed that the input was the path to follow, and from there, the task was to find the shortest route. I
spent about an hour trying to implement a recursive method, but as I‚Äôm not yet accustomed to them, I hit a roadblock.
When I finally found a working algorithm, I realized that the assignment requirements were different. So, I had to start
over. <br>

However, the assignment turned out to be much simpler than I had initially thought. I was able to utilize the Noeud
class and method I had previously created and build upon it.

I then simply followed the input until I reached the destination.

#### Concepts learned

- recursive is one of my weak points
- I really need to read the assignment more carefully

### [Part 2](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day8/part2.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ

#### Duration: 45 minutes

This one was challenging, particularly because there was no issue with the algorithm. However, I thought there might be
a problem since I couldn't find the solution. So, I spent some time verifying that the algorithm wasn't the issue. <br>

Honestly, I considered the smallest common multiple from the beginning, but I was unsure about implementing it from
different starting points. I consulted a professor to confirm if I was on the right track, and he affirmed it. <br>

I was aware that there was a simple algorithm to find the least common multiple (LCM), but I didn't know it by heart.
So, I asked Bing chat to do it for me. <br>

I first looked for the first time each path would reach a `..Z`. Once it reached a `..Z`, I made it loop again to find
the next time it would return to it. That's when I realized that they looped perfectly, which was a significant help.
Honestly, I'm still not sure how I was supposed to make it work from different starting points.<br>

So I had to find the different _cycles_ for each starting point and find the LCM between them.

#### Concepts learned

- LCM algorithm
- GCF algorithm

## [Day 9](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day9)

### [Part 1](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day9/part1.py)

#### Difficulty: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

#### Duration: 1 hour

The puzzle left me more impressed than necessary. I anticipated it to be more challenging given that it's the weekend,
but it turned out to be less daunting than expected. <br>

I approached the exercise by handling each input individually. I aim to continue this approach as much as possible, as I
believe it's more logical. <br>

Initially, I struggled to grasp the input, often forgetting my task. However, I eventually managed to fully wake up and
focus. <br>

For each input, I constructed the entire pyramid. I used the sum of the line to check if it was entirely composed of
zeros, which I thought was a clever idea. However, I later realized that this could pose problems if the line contained
negative numbers and the sum coincidentally equaled zero.<br>

I then appended an extra zero to the last line. I iterated in reverse order, adding the last element of the current line
and the previous one to the preceding line. <br>

Once the pyramid was complete, I added the last element from the first line to a variable.

#### Concepts learned

- I need some time to wake up

### [Part 2](https://github.com/guimochi/advent_of_code2023/blob/main/day9/part2.py)

#### Difficulty: üß∏

#### Duration: 5 minutes

There‚Äôs not much to elaborate on here. Simply subtract instead of adding, and insert at the beginning rather than at the
end. That‚Äôs essentially all there is to it.
